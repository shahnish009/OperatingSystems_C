## Randomized QuickSort and Binary Search - Phone Directory (Divide and Conquer):
A smartphone like phone directory implemented in C++ which reads the contact data from the text file, sorts them alphabetically (implements the randomized quick-sort algorithm) and searches for the data needed (implements binary search algorithm)
This phone directory also features the insertion and deletion of the contacts
Sorted phone directory is always what we see

## Strassen's Matrix Multiplication and Tromino Tiling (Divide and Conquer Algorithms):
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm supports all kind of positive legitimate inputs and decreases the time complexity for the Multiplication of Matrices
Tromino Tiling Algorithm solves the tiling problem very efficiently

## Knapsack and Dijkstra (Dynamic programming and Greedy Algorithms):
Implemented Knapsack Algorithms by using both Greedy and Dynamic programming
Dijkstra Algorithm to find the Shortest Path from a point to all other points in Directed Graph
