## Creating and Destroying Process Hierarchy using Linux System Calls - Linux / C (Google Cloud Platform)
Program to recursively create a process hierarchy tree with positive height where each child process on each height have C children each
Systematically terminate all the processes in the tree. 
This project is implemented using Linux system calls on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Strassen's Matrix Multiplication and Tromino Tiling (Divide and Conquer Algorithms):
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm supports all kind of positive legitimate inputs and decreases the time complexity for the Multiplication of Matrices
Tromino Tiling Algorithm solves the tiling problem very efficiently

## Knapsack and Dijkstra (Dynamic programming and Greedy Algorithms):
Implemented Knapsack Algorithms by using both Greedy and Dynamic programming
Dijkstra Algorithm to find the Shortest Path from a point to all other points in Directed Graph
