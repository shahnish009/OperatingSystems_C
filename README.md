## Creating and Destroying Process Hierarchy using Linux System Calls - Linux / C (Google Cloud Platform)
Program to recursively create a process hierarchy tree with positive height where each child process on each height have C children each
Systematically terminate all the processes in the tree. 
This project is implemented using Linux system calls on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Character Device Kernel Module - Linux / C (Google Cloud Platform)
Implementation of a kernel module that creates character device that supports the read() operation
When the read() system call is invoked on the character device from a user space process, the kernel module returns the information of all currently running processes (process ID, parent process ID, the CPU on which the process is running, its current state)

## Knapsack and Dijkstra (Dynamic programming and Greedy Algorithms):
Implemented Knapsack Algorithms by using both Greedy and Dynamic programming
Dijkstra Algorithm to find the Shortest Path from a point to all other points in Directed Graph
